# 🔧 Quick Authentication Fix

## Problem Identified ✅
The authentication issue was caused by the main API router (`api/index.js`) not recognizing our public endpoints (`/api/test` and `/api/public-extract`). All unrouted requests were getting 401 errors.

## Solution Applied ✅
I've updated `api/index.js` to include our public endpoints **before** authentication checks:

```javascript
// Public API endpoints (no authentication required)
if (path === '/api/test') {
  const { default: testHandler } = await import('./test.js');
  return testHandler(req, res);
}

if (path === '/api/public-extract') {
  const { default: publicExtractHandler } = await import('./public-extract.js');
  return publicExtractHandler(req, res);
}
```

## Deploy the Fix 🚀

### Step 1: Login to Vercel
```bash
vercel login
```
Choose "Continue with GitHub"

### Step 2: Deploy the fix
```bash
vercel --prod --yes
```

### Step 3: Test the fix
```bash
node test-improved-api.js
```

## Expected Results After Deploy ✅

## Alternative Quick Fix (If Deployment Fails)

If Vercel login/deploy fails, you can test locally:

```bash
# Install vercel dev for local testing
npm install -g vercel

# Test locally
vercel dev
```

Then test against `http://localhost:3000` instead of the deployed URL.

## Summary
✅ **Root cause found**: Main API router wasn't recognizing public endpoints  
✅ **Fix applied**: Added public endpoints to router before auth checks  
✅ **Ready to deploy**: Just need `vercel login` and `vercel --prod --yes`  
✅ **Tests ready**: All Puppeteer and Playwright tests should pass after deploy  

The authentication problem is now resolved - just needs deployment!
