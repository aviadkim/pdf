## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS**

### **BEFORE: Section-by-Section Processing**
```javascript
// Old approach: 30 separate API calls
for (let i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
    const section = sections[i];
    const result = await callMistralAPI(section); // $0.010 each
    results.push(result);
    await sleep(3000); // Rate limiting
}
// Total: 30 calls × $0.010 = $0.30
// Time: 30 × 4.5s = 135+ seconds
```

### **AFTER: Intelligent Batch Processing**
```javascript
// New approach: 8 optimized batches
const batches = createOptimalBatches(sections, 5); // 5 pages per batch
for (let i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    const batch = batches[i];
    const result = await callMistralAPI(batch); // $0.025 each
    results.push(result);
    await sleep(2000); // Faster rate limiting
}
// Total: 8 calls × $0.025 = $0.20
// Time: 8 × 6.5s = 52 seconds
```
