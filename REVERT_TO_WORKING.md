# ðŸš¨ REVERT TO WORKING SYSTEM

## DISASTER ASSESSMENT
The experimental processors are performing terribly:
- precision-column-fix: 17.27% accuracy (disaster!)
- smart-table-parser: Over-extracting billions
- precision-simple: Over-calibrated at $31.6M

## WORKING BASELINE
âœ… **intelligent-messos-processor**
- Accuracy: 99.8% 
- Total: $19.42M (matches target $19.46M)
- Holdings: 38 securities
- Processing: ~7 seconds
- Status: PRODUCTION READY

## IMMEDIATE ACTION
Stop all experimental development and focus on:
1. Use intelligent-messos-processor as the main endpoint
2. Fix only the specific value discrepancies within that working system
3. Do NOT create new experimental processors

## USER FEEDBACK
"bring it back it is a disaster" - referring to precision-column-fix
- Only 16 holdings vs 38-40 expected
- $3.36M vs $19.46M target
- Missing all key securities
- 17.27% accuracy is unacceptable

## RECOMMENDATION
Revert all testing to the intelligent processor and make minor fixes there rather than building new systems from scratch.
