- **Run with:** `npm run test:full-suite`

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers (if not already installed)
npx playwright install
```

### Running Tests

#### Run Individual Test Suites
```bash
# API endpoint tests (recommended first)
npm run test:production

# UI automation tests
npm run test:playwright:annotation

# Browser processing tests
npm run test:puppeteer

# Performance/load tests
npm run test:load
```

#### Run All Tests
```bash
# Complete test suite (takes 15-30 minutes)
npm run test:full-suite
```

## 📊 Test Results

### Result Locations
- **Screenshots:** `test-results/` directory
- **JSON Reports:** `test-results/comprehensive-test-report-*.json`

- **Playwright Reports:** `playwright-report/` directory

### Expected Results

#### ✅ Healthy System Indicators
- Health endpoint responds with 200 status
- API endpoints process PDFs within 30 seconds
- Accuracy > 90% for Messos PDF extraction
- Error rate < 10% under load
- All UI elements load and function properly

#### ⚠️ Warning Signs

- **Concurrent Support:** 4+ simultaneous requests

### Test Data
- **Primary Test PDF:** `Messos_Anlagestiftung_Full_Report.pdf`
- **Expected Securities:** 40 unique ISINs
- **Expected Total Value:** $19,464,431

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

### API Response Times
- **Health Check:** < 1 second
- **System Capabilities:** < 2 seconds
- **PDF Processing:** 10-60 seconds (depending on complexity)
- **OCR Processing:** 15-90 seconds

### Accuracy Targets
- **Ultra Accurate Extract:** > 92%
- **Phase 2 Enhanced:** > 90%
- **Mistral OCR:** > 85%

### Load Testing Limits
- **Light Load:** 2 concurrent users, 10 requests
- **Medium Load:** 4 concurrent users, 20 requests  
- **Heavy Load:** 6 concurrent users, 30 requests

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Test PDF Not Found
```bash
# Ensure test PDF exists
ls -la Messos_Anlagestiftung_Full_Report.pdf
```

#### Playwright Browser Issues
```bash
# Reinstall browsers
npx playwright install --force
```

#### Network Timeouts
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify Render deployment is active
- Try reducing concurrent test load

#### Permission Errors
```bash
# Fix file permissions
chmod +x run-comprehensive-tests.js
```

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test single endpoint
curl -X GET https://pdf-fzzi.onrender.com/health

# Check system capabilities
curl -X GET https://pdf-fzzi.onrender.com/api/system-capabilities

# Run minimal test
node -e "console.log('Node.js working:', process.version)"
```

## 📋 Test Checklist

Before running tests, ensure:
- [ ] `npm install` completed successfully
- [ ] Test PDF file exists
- [ ] Internet connection is stable
- [ ] Render deployment is active and healthy
- [ ] GraphicsMagick dependencies are installed on target system

## 🔄 Continuous Testing

### Automated Scheduling
Consider setting up automated test runs:
```bash
# Daily health check
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/project && npm run test:production

# Weekly comprehensive test
0 10 * * 1 cd /path/to/project && npm run test:full-suite
```

### Integration with CI/CD
Add to your deployment pipeline:
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Run Production Tests
  run: npm run test:production
  continue-on-error: true
```

## 📝 Reporting Issues

When reporting test failures, include:
1. **Test suite name** and specific test that failed
2. **Error messages** from console output
3. **Screenshots** from test-results directory
4. **System info** (Node.js version, OS, network)
5. **Timestamp** when tests were run

## 🎯 Next Steps

After running tests:
1. **Review HTML report** for detailed analysis
2. **Check screenshots** for visual validation
3. **Monitor trends** in accuracy and performance
4. **Update benchmarks** as system improves
5. **Expand test coverage** for new features
