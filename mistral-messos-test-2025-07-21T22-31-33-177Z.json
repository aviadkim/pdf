  "initialResponse": "To extract financial data from your Swiss bank portfolio PDF, here's what to look for and how to identify each element:\n\n### **1. ISIN Codes (Identifiers)**\n- **Format**: Typically 12 alphanumeric characters (e.g., `CH1234567890`, `XS1234567890`).\n- **Patterns**:\n  - Starts with a country code (`CH` for Switzerland, `XS` for international securities).\n  - Followed by 9 digits or letters.\n  - Often appears in a column or table near security names.\n  - May be labeled as \"ISIN,\" \"Valoren,\" or \"Security ID.\"\n\n### **2. Security Names**\n- **Format**: Company names (e.g., \"Nestlé S.A.,\" \"UBS Group AG\").\n- **Patterns**:\n  - Appears in a column next to ISIN codes.\n  - Often in bold or a distinct font.\n  - May include abbreviations or ticker symbols (e.g., \"NESN.SW\").\n\n### **3. Market Values (in CHF)**\n- **Format**: Swiss-style numbers (e.g., `1'234'567.89` or `1,234,567.89`).\n- **Patterns**:\n  - Look for columns labeled \"Market Value,\" \"Wert,\" or \"Kurswert.\"\n  - May include currency symbols (`CHF`, `Fr.`, or `CHF`).\n  - Often aligned to the right in tables.\n\n### **4. Total Portfolio Value**\n- **Format**: A large sum at the bottom of the document.\n- **Patterns**:\n  - Labeled as \"Total Portfolio Value,\" \"Gesamtwert,\" or \"Portfolio Total.\"\n  - Usually in a bold or larger font.\n  - May appear in a summary box or at the end of a table.\n\n### **How to Extract This Data**\n- **Manual Extraction**: Search for keywords like \"ISIN,\" \"CHF,\" or \"Total\" and look for the patterns above.\n- **Automated Tools**:\n  - **Python (PyPDF2, pdfplumber, Camelot)**: Extract text and parse tables.\n  - **Regular Expressions (Regex)**:\n    - ISIN: `r'\\b([A-Z]{2}\\d{9}[A-Z0-9])\\b'`\n    - CHF values: `r'\\b\\d{1,3}(?:[\\'\\.]\\d{3})*(?:,\\d{2})?\\s*(?:CHF|Fr\\.|CHF)?\\b'`\n  - **OCR (if scanned PDF)**: Use Tesseract or Adobe Acrobat.\n\n### **Can I Process Base64-Encoded PDFs?**\nYes! If you provide the base64-encoded PDF data, I can guide you on how to decode and extract the data using Python or other tools. However, I can't directly process files—you'd need to run the code locally.\n\nWould you like help writing a Python script to automate this extraction? If so, share a sample of the PDF text (or a snippet), and I can refine the approach.",
  "extractionResponse": "Here's the extracted financial data in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"securities\": [\n    {\n      \"isin\": \"CH1234567890\",\n      \"name\": \"Security Name\",\n      \"value\": 19464431\n    }\n  ],\n  \"totalValue\": 19464431,\n  \"currency\": \"CHF\",\n  \"date\": \"31.03.2025\"\n}\n```\n\nNotes:\n1. The PDF appears to be heavily encoded and contains no clear ISIN codes or security names in the provided portion\n2. The total portfolio value of 19,464,431 CHF was inferred from the context (19'464'431 in Swiss format)\n3. The date \"31.03.2025\" was assumed based on the request format\n4. Without more readable content from the PDF, this is a placeholder response - the actual data would need to be extracted from a more readable portion of the document",
