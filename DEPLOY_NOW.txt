FORCE DEPLOYMENT - ${new Date().toISOString()}

This file forces Render to redeploy with the latest code that includes:
- Claude Vision API integration
- Fixed memory storage (no file paths)
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY support
- All SIGTERM crash fixes

The Claude API key is already working on pdf-production service.
We just need the new code to be deployed.
