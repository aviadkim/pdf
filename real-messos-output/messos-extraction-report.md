## Analysis
**Needs Improvement:** The extraction system requires refinement in distinguishing between different numeric fields 
in the PDF (market values vs. Valor codes vs. quantities). Table structure parsing needs enhancement.

## Next Steps
1. **Improve Parser:** Enhance table structure recognition
2. **Fix Value Extraction:** Better distinguish market values from Valor numbers
3. **Add Context Analysis:** Use surrounding text to identify data types
4. **Test and Iterate:** Refine algorithms with more test cases
