# 🔧 Render Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status: Old Vercel Build Still Running

The deployment analysis shows that the Smart OCR system is not yet active. Here's how to fix it:

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Check Render Dashboard
- Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
- Find your service: `pdf-fzzi`
- Click on the service name

### 2. Verify Service Settings
Check these settings in your service configuration:

```yaml
Environment: Docker
Dockerfile Path: ./Dockerfile.smart-ocr
Build Command: (leave empty for Docker)
Start Command: npm start
```

### 3. Set Environment Variables
Ensure these are configured in Environment tab:
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10002
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_actual_mistral_key
MISTRAL_ENDPOINT=https://api.mistral.ai/v1
```

### 4. Force New Deployment
- Go to "Deploys" tab
- Click "Manual Deploy"
- Select "Deploy latest commit"

## 🔍 If Build Fails

### Check Build Logs
Common issues and solutions:

1. **"playwright: not found"** (This should be fixed now)
   - ✅ Fixed by changing `npm ci --only=production` to `npm ci`

2. **"npm install failed"**
   - Check if package.json is in root directory
   - Verify dependencies are correct

3. **"Docker build failed"**
   - Check Dockerfile.smart-ocr syntax
   - Ensure all files are committed to git

## 🎯 Expected Results After Fix

When deployment succeeds, you should see:
- ✅ `https://pdf-fzzi.onrender.com/api/smart-ocr-test` → Returns JSON
- ✅ `https://pdf-fzzi.onrender.com/smart-annotation` → Shows annotation interface
- ✅ Build logs show: "Smart OCR Learning System starting..."

## 📞 If Still Having Issues

1. **Check Dockerfile.smart-ocr** exists and is correct
2. **Verify git repository** has the latest changes
3. **Try creating a new service** as backup option
4. **Check Render service logs** for specific error messages
