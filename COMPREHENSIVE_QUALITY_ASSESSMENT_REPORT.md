### **🏢 Back Office Integration Examples**

#### **Portfolio Management System Integration**
```javascript
// Example: Bloomberg AIM Integration
const portfolioData = await fetch('/api/v1/portfolios/12345');
const securities = portfolioData.securities;

// Update Bloomberg AIM positions
for (const security of securities) {
  await bloombergAIM.updatePosition({
    isin: security.isin,
    quantity: security.quantity,
    marketValue: security.marketValue,
    currency: security.currency
  });
}
```

#### **Risk Management System Integration**
```javascript
// Example: Axioma Risk Integration
const riskData = {
  portfolioId: '12345',
  positions: securities.map(s => ({
    instrument: s.isin,
    weight: s.marketValue / portfolioData.portfolio.totalValue,
    currency: s.currency
  }))
};

await axiomaRisk.calculateRisk(riskData);
```

#### **Regulatory Reporting Integration**
```javascript
// Example: Basel III Reporting
const baselReport = {
  reportingDate: new Date(),
  positions: securities.map(s => ({
    instrument: s.isin,
    exposureValue: s.marketValue,
    riskWeight: calculateRiskWeight(s.type, s.rating),
    capitalRequirement: s.marketValue * 0.08 // Simplified
  }))
};

await regulatorySystem.submitBaselReport(baselReport);
```

### **💰 Business Case Calculator**

#### **Cost-Benefit Analysis Tool**
```javascript
function calculateBusinessImpact(monthlyDocuments, currentManualCost) {
  const automatedCost = monthlyDocuments * 0.13; // $0.13 per document
  const monthlySavings = currentManualCost - automatedCost;
  const annualSavings = monthlySavings * 12;
  const paybackPeriod = 150000 / monthlySavings; // Implementation cost

  return {
    monthlySavings,
    annualSavings,
    paybackPeriod: `${paybackPeriod.toFixed(1)} months`,
    roi: `${((annualSavings / 150000) * 100).toFixed(0)}%`
  };
}

// Example: 1000 documents/month, $500/month current cost
const impact = calculateBusinessImpact(1000, 500);
// Result: $370/month savings, $4,440/year, 34 months payback, 296% ROI
