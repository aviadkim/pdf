# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT FIX INSTRUCTIONS

## Problem
Render is NOT running the updated code despite manual deployment. The system still returns 0 securities instead of 39.

## Solution: Force Complete Reset

### Step 1: Check Render Dashboard
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Check if build/deployment failed
3. Look for any error messages in logs

### Step 2: Force Environment Refresh  
```bash
# In Render Environment Variables, temporarily change:
NODE_ENV=development
# Then change back to:
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Step 3: Trigger New Build
1. Make a small change to any file
2. Push to trigger new deployment
3. OR use Render "Manual Deploy" button

### Step 4: Check Build Logs
- Look for "BYPASSING Smart OCR" message
- Verify smart-ocr-server.js is being used

## Expected Result
- Homepage should show: "Direct PDF parsing bypass enabled (v2.1)"
- API should extract 39 securities with market values
- Accuracy should be 92.21%

## If Still Fails
The issue might be:
1. Wrong start script in package.json
2. Render using cached version
3. Build process not copying files correctly

Let me know which step fails and I'll provide specific fix.
