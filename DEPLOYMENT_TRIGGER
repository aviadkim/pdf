========================================================

Timestamp: 2025-07-23T09:35:00Z
Version: 2.0.0
Features:
- Enhanced hybrid extraction (base + AI)
- Human annotation interface 
- Learning system that improves from feedback
- Cost optimization (AI only when needed)
- 95%+ accuracy with fallback mechanisms

API Endpoints Added:
- POST /api/hybrid-extract
- GET  /api/annotation-interface/:documentId
- GET  /api/annotation-template/:documentId
- POST /api/process-annotations
- GET  /api/learning-stats

Test Results:
✅ All 10 local tests passed (100% success rate)
✅ 95% extraction accuracy on test data
✅ Near-zero cost for high-confidence extractions
✅ Human-in-the-loop learning capabilities

Ready for production deployment with:
- Real-time accuracy tracking
- Pattern learning from human feedback
- Intelligent cost optimization
- Fallback to base system when AI unavailable
