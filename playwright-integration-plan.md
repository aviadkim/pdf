# Playwright MCP Integration Plan for Phase 3 PDF Platform
## Self-Healing Development System Implementation

### Overview
Integrate Microsoft's Playwright MCP with our Phase 3 PDF extraction system to create a self-healing development environment that can automatically test, debug, and fix our financial document processing platform.

### Implementation Strategy (Windows Native - No WSL)

#### Phase 1: Basic Playwright Setup (Week 1)
```powershell
# Install Playwright on Windows
npm install -g @playwright/test
npx playwright install chromium
npm install microsoft-playwright-mcp

# Configure for our PDF processing system
playwright.config.js setup for financial document testing
```

#### Phase 2: Automated Testing Integration (Week 2)
**Test Coverage for Our System:**
1. **PDF Upload Flow Testing**
   - Automated document upload simulation
   - Progress bar validation
   - Error handling verification

2. **Extraction Accuracy Testing**
   - Screenshot comparison of results tables
   - Mathematical validation automation
   - Portfolio value verification

3. **Real-time Processing Validation**
   - Console log monitoring during extraction
   - Performance timing validation
   - Memory usage tracking

#### Phase 3: Self-Healing Implementation (Week 3)
**Auto-Fix Capabilities:**
1. **JavaScript Error Resolution**
   - Automatic error detection in web interface
   - Self-healing code generation for common issues
   - Real-time bug fixes during development

2. **UI Consistency Maintenance**
   - Screenshot-based UI regression testing
   - Automatic CSS fixes for layout issues
   - Responsive design validation

3. **API Integration Testing**
   - Automated endpoint testing for Phase 3 processor
   - Error response handling validation
   - Performance optimization suggestions

### Specific Use Cases for Our Financial Platform

#### 1. PDF Processing Pipeline Testing
```javascript
// Automated test for our 40-security extraction
test('Extract all securities from Messos PDF', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:5000');
  
  // Upload PDF
  await page.setInputFiles('input[type="file"]', 'test-files/messos-portfolio.pdf');
  
  // Start extraction
  await page.click('button:has-text("Start Phase 3 Extraction")');
  
  // Wait for completion and validate results
  await page.waitForSelector('.results-section');
  
  // Screenshot for validation
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'extraction-results.png' });
  
  // Validate 40 securities extracted
  const securityCount = await page.textContent('#totalSecurities');
  expect(securityCount).toBe('40');
  
  // Check portfolio value
  const portfolioValue = await page.textContent('#portfolioValue');
  expect(portfolioValue).toContain('$4,');
});
```

#### 2. Accuracy Validation Testing
```javascript
// Test our 99.5% accuracy claim
test('Validate extraction accuracy on known test cases', async ({ page }) => {
  // Known test data
  const testCases = {
    'XS2530201644': { quantity: 200000, price: 99.1991, value: 199080 },
    'XS2588105036': { quantity: 200000, price: 99.6285, value: 200288 }
  };
  
  // Process and validate each security
  for (const [isin, expected] of Object.entries(testCases)) {
    const row = page.locator(`tr:has-text("${isin}")`);
    
    // Validate extracted values match expected
    const quantity = await row.locator('td:nth-child(3)').textContent();
    const price = await row.locator('td:nth-child(4)').textContent();
    const value = await row.locator('td:nth-child(5)').textContent();
    
    // Accuracy assertions
    expect(parseFloat(quantity.replace(',', ''))).toBeCloseTo(expected.quantity, -2);
    expect(parseFloat(price.replace('$', ''))).toBeCloseTo(expected.price, 3);
    expect(parseFloat(value.replace(/[$,]/g, ''))).toBeCloseTo(expected.value, 0);
  }
});
```

#### 3. Self-Healing Web Interface
```javascript
// Automatic UI bug detection and fixing
test('Self-healing UI validation', async ({ page, context }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:5000');
  
  // Take baseline screenshot
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'baseline-ui.png' });
  
  // Check for console errors
  page.on('console', msg => {
    if (msg.type() === 'error') {
      console.log('JS Error detected:', msg.text());
      // Trigger self-healing process
      healJavaScriptError(msg.text());
    }
  });
  
  // Validate UI elements are functional
  await page.click('button:has-text("Start Phase 3 Extraction")');
  
  // Screenshot comparison for UI regression
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'current-ui.png' });
  
  // Auto-fix any detected issues
  await autoFixUIIssues(page);
});
```
